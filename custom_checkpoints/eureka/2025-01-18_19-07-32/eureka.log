To design a reward function that encourages the humanoid to run as fast as possible, we need to focus on maximizing its velocity towards the target direction. We can do this by using the magnitude of the velocity vector as a key component of the reward. Additionally, to promote stability and proper orientation during running, we can incorporate penalties or components that keep the humanoid upright and aligned with the target direction.

Here's a TorchScript-compatible reward function that achieves this:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor, dt: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Compute the direction to the target on the ground plane
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    normalized_to_target = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    
    # Speed component: project velocity onto the target direction
    speed_along_target = (velocity * normalized_to_target).sum(dim=-1)
    
    # Maintain upright position (reward for being close to upright)
    # Assuming z-axis (2nd index) is "up" in torso_position
    upright_bonus = torch.exp(-torch.abs(torso_position[:, 2] - 1.0))
    
    # Calculate overall reward
    speed_reward_weight = 1.0
    upright_bonus_weight = 0.5
    
    # Apply exponential transformation
    speed_temp = 0.1
    upright_temp = 0.1

    speed_reward = speed_reward_weight * torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_along_target)
    upright_reward = upright_bonus_weight * torch.exp(upright_temp * upright_bonus)

    total_reward = speed_reward + upright_reward

    rewards = {
        "speed_reward": speed_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward
    }

    return total_reward, rewards
```

### Explanation:
1. **Speed Component**: Reward component that encourages the humanoid to run faster by projecting its current velocity onto the direction towards the target. This is the primary component for encouraging speed.

2. **Upright Bonus**: Extra reward for maintaining an upright position. This helps in encouraging the humanoid to stay balanced while running.

3. **Reward Weights and Temperatures**: `speed_reward_weight` and `upright_bonus_weight` are introduced to control the contribution of individual components to the total reward. Exponential transformations with temperature parameters (`speed_temp` and `upright_temp`) are applied to normalize and make these reward components more effective.

4. **Normalization**: The to-target vector is normalized to ensure the velocity projection calculation is correct.

This reward function works with inputs from the environment's `root_states` and `targets`, while ensuring compatibility with the TorchScript framework.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
speed_reward: ['1.00', '1.02', '1.10', '1.15', '1.19', '1.24', '1.30', '1.34', '1.37', '1.39'], Max: 1.43, Mean: 1.23, Min: 1.00 
upright_reward: ['0.54', '0.54', '0.54', '0.54', '0.54', '0.54', '0.54', '0.54', '0.54', '0.54'], Max: 0.55, Mean: 0.54, Min: 0.54 
task_score: ['-0.05', '0.15', '0.92', '1.35', '1.76', '2.11', '2.57', '2.87', '3.11', '3.22'], Max: 3.51, Mean: 1.98, Min: -0.05 
episode_lengths: ['31.88', '968.88', '954.52', '960.53', '958.91', '979.90', '945.13', '964.70', '929.69', '931.67'], Max: 994.15, Mean: 920.75, Min: 24.75 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Let's analyze the provided policy feedback:

1. **Speed Reward**: The values are increasing and have some variability, indicating that the RL policy is able to optimize this component. However, there's likely room for further incentivizing higher speeds since the rate of increase slows down.

2. **Upright Reward**: The values are near identical throughout the training, suggesting that the RL policy is unable to optimize this component effectively. This implies the transformation or its scale might not be proper, or the component itself isn't contributing effectively to the overall task.

3. **Task Score**: The values show an increasing trend, indicating overall task success. However, there's a need to ensure this trend is more consistent.

4. **Episode Lengths**: The lengths seem to vary greatly, but overall they're spanning near the maximum. This means the humanoid is generally maintaining episodes, but more consistency or longer episodes might be desired. A penalty component for certain undesired states (like falling) could help.

To improve the reward function, let's make the following changes:

- **Adjustment of the Upright Reward Component**: Modify the upright reward to ensure it's optimized effectively and contributes meaningfully. This could involve re-scaling or changing its nature.

- **Introduction of a Stability Component**: Add a penalty or a bonus related to stability, particularly to penalize falling or being in states that could end episodes prematurely.

Here's an improved reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant state information
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Compute direction to target and normalize
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    normalized_to_target = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    
    # Speed component: Project velocity onto the target direction
    speed_along_target = (velocity * normalized_to_target).sum(dim=-1)
    
    # Maintain upright position (reward for being close to upright)
    # Assume target_z indicates optimal standing height
    target_z = 1.0
    z_deviation = torch.abs(torso_position[:, 2] - target_z)
    upright_bonus = torch.exp(-z_deviation)  # More sensitive upright component
    
    # Penalize deviations from stable orientations (e.g., falling)
    # Assuming stable upright when z_deviation is small
    stability_penalty_weight = 1.0
    stability_penalty = stability_penalty_weight * z_deviation
    
    # Calculate overall reward
    speed_reward_weight = 1.0
    upright_bonus_weight = 0.5
    stability_penalty_weight = 0.2
    
    # Temperature parameters for transformations
    speed_temp = 0.1
    upright_temp = 0.2
    
    speed_reward = speed_reward_weight * torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_along_target)
    upright_reward = upright_bonus_weight * torch.exp(upright_temp * upright_bonus)
    
    # Subtract stabilization penalty
    total_reward = speed_reward + upright_reward - stability_penalty_weight * stability_penalty

    rewards = {
        "speed_reward": speed_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, rewards
```

### Changes Made:
- **Upright Reward**: Adjusted its transformation to make the policy more responsive to small changes in height deviation, potentially leading to better upright performance.
- **Stability Penalty**: Introduced a penalty for getting too far from the desired upright torso height, which can prevent the humanoid from falling over and ending episodes prematurely.
- **Re-scales**: Temperatures and weights adjusted to ensure the upright component plays a significant role.

This modified reward function aims to better align each component with improving the task metrics: running fast while maintaining a stable and upright posture.

Given the feedback provided for the RL policy:

1. **Speed Reward**: This component seems to be optimizing well, with values steadily increasing. The speed reward values range from 1.00 to 1.56 and don't exhibit any problematic stagnation. Thus, we should maintain this reward component with slight adjustments to temperature if needed.

2. **Upright Reward**: The values are nearly identical throughout (0.59 to 0.61), indicating that this component isn't effectively influencing the training process. To address this, we should consider adjusting its temperature parameter or rewriting its formulation to make it more sensitive.

3. **Stability Penalty**: This component shows a marked decrease from 0.21 to 0.03, which is positive since it's a penalty. This suggests it's effective in penalizing states that might destabilize the humanoid. However, further optimization can be attempted by refining its scale or transformation as needed.

4. **Task Score**: There is an increasing trend indicating task achievement success, but there's room for improvement by ensuring higher values and mitigating any episodes that could be holding back the mean or minimums.

5. **Episode Lengths**: The episode lengths show some variability but generally hover near the maximum, indicating that generally stable running is achieved.

Now, I'll provide a revised reward function based on these observations, adjusting weights and temperatures to better influence the training outcomes.

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant state information
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Compute direction to target and normalize
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    normalized_to_target = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    
    # Speed component: Project velocity onto the target direction
    speed_along_target = (velocity * normalized_to_target).sum(dim=-1)
    
    # Maintain upright position (reward for being close to upright)
    target_z = 1.0
    z_deviation = torch.abs(torso_position[:, 2] - target_z)
    upright_bonus = 1.0 - z_deviation  # Linearly discourage deviation

    # Penalize deviations from stable orientations (e.g., falling)
    stability_penalty_weight = 1.0
    stability_penalty = stability_penalty_weight * z_deviation
    
    # Calculate overall reward
    speed_reward_weight = 1.0
    upright_bonus_weight = 1.0
    stability_penalty_weight = 0.3
    
    # Temperature parameters for transformations
    speed_temp = 0.1
    upright_temp = 0.5
    
    speed_reward = speed_reward_weight * torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_along_target)
    upright_reward = upright_bonus_weight * torch.exp(upright_temp * upright_bonus)
    
    # Subtract stabilization penalty
    total_reward = speed_reward + upright_reward - stability_penalty_weight * stability_penalty

    rewards = {
        "speed_reward": speed_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, rewards
```

### Adjustments Made:
- **Upright Reward**: Changed the upright calculation to linearly discourage deviation and increased its temperature to make it more sensitive.
- **Stability Penalty**: Maintained but ensured it complements upright control for effective task performance.
- **Component Temperatures**: Adjusted temperatures for speed and upright components to ensure effective transformation, making the agent more responsive to incremental improvements in posture and speed.

The goal of these changes is to achieve a more balanced incentive structure, promoting speed while maintaining stability and an upright position, thereby improving overall task performance and episode consistency.

        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the policy feedback, let's analyze each reward component and make necessary adjustments:

1. **Speed Reward**: The speed reward seems to be improving and is in a reasonable range. However, its effect could be strengthened by increasing its scale slightly to encourage faster speeds.

2. **Upright Reward**: The values are effectively constant after a few epochs. This indicates that simply linearly discouraging deviation might not be impactful enough. We could transform this reward by introducing a quadratic or exponentially decreasing penalty for deviation from the desired height.

3. **Stability Penalty**: The penalty shows a decreasing trend, indicating it's effective. However, since its mean value is small, we can adjust its scale relative to other components to maintain the balance.

4. **Overall Task Score**: The overall task score improves over time, demonstrating progress, but we can better align the reward components for more consistent improvement across episodes.

5. **Episode Lengths**: The large variability indicates that stability improvements at the start could drastically improve the consistency of runs, indicating the need to reinforce the upright and stability components further.

Here's the improved reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant state information
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Compute direction to target and normalize
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    normalized_to_target = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    
    # Speed component: Project velocity onto the target direction
    speed_along_target = (velocity * normalized_to_target).sum(dim=-1)
    
    # Maintain upright position (reward for being close to upright)
    # Use a quadratic downward penalty for deviation from the target height
    target_z = 1.0
    z_deviation = torch.abs(torso_position[:, 2] - target_z)
    upright_bonus = torch.maximum(torch.tensor([0.0], device=torso_position.device), 1.0 - z_deviation ** 2)
    
    # Stability penalty (equivalent to z deviation)
    stability_penalty_weight = 1.5
    stability_penalty = stability_penalty_weight * z_deviation
    
    # Calculate overall reward
    speed_reward_weight = 1.5
    upright_bonus_weight = 1.2
    
    # Temperature parameters for transformations
    speed_temp = 0.2
    upright_temp = 0.8
    
    speed_reward = speed_reward_weight * torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_along_target)
    upright_reward = upright_bonus_weight * torch.exp(upright_temp * upright_bonus)
    
    # Total reward
    total_reward = speed_reward + upright_reward - stability_penalty
    
    rewards = {
        "speed_reward": speed_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, rewards
```

### Key Adjustments Made:
- **Increased Speed Component Scale**: To further promote increased speed, boosting the agent's ability to achieve the task quickly.
- **Quadratic Penalty for Upright Position**: A more robust function that penalizes the upright deviation to provide a strong corrective force, allowing the policy to better optimize this component.
- **Stability Penalty Rescaling**: Increase the weight of this component slightly to ensure stabilization.
- **Temperature Adjustment**: Adjusted the temperature of both primary reward components to ensure dynamic range is effectively utilized. 

With these improvements, the reward structure aims to incentivize the agent to achieve the optimal balance between speed and stability over sustained periods.

Analyzing the policy feedback and reward component values:

1. **Speed Reward**:
   - This component is scaling well with time. However, given the fluctuations in other metrics, there might be room to enhance its influence on the overall task score.

2. **Upright Reward**:
   - The values are nearly identical and saturate around 2.67. This indicates that the component does not effectively guide the policy towards desired behavior beyond a certain point. Adjusting the scaling or rewriting the component is necessary.

3. **Stability Penalty**:
   - This metric is effectively managed with low minimal values indicating some success in reducing penalties related to stability.

4. **Task Score**:
   - The task score is improving but relatively slowly. Considering the episode lengths, there's room for shorter or more consistent episodes without sacrificing performance.
  
Given these observations, here's how we can improve the reward function:

- Re-scale the upright reward to increase its impact.
- Introduce a new reward component to encourage smooth joint movements, which could directly enhance stability and performance.
  
Here's the updated reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_vel: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract relevant state information
    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]
    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]
    
    # Compute direction to target and normalize
    to_target = targets - torso_position
    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0
    normalized_to_target = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)
    
    # Speed component: Project velocity onto the target direction
    speed_along_target = (velocity * normalized_to_target).sum(dim=-1)
    
    # Maintain upright position (modified to scale appropriately with additional temperature)
    target_z = 1.0
    z_deviation = torch.abs(torso_position[:, 2] - target_z)
    upright_temp = 1.0
    upright_bonus = torch.exp(-upright_temp * z_deviation)

    # Stability penalty and joint smoothness reward (to encourage smooth motion)
    stability_penalty_weight = 1.0
    stability_penalty = stability_penalty_weight * z_deviation
    
    dof_velocity_penalty_weight = 0.1
    joint_smoothness_reward = torch.exp(-dof_velocity_penalty_weight * torch.norm(dof_vel, p=1, dim=-1))
    
    # Calculate overall reward
    speed_reward_weight = 1.0
    upright_bonus_weight = 0.5
    joint_smoothness_weight = 0.4
    
    speed_temp = 0.2
    
    speed_reward = speed_reward_weight * torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_along_target)
    upright_reward = upright_bonus_weight * upright_bonus
    joint_smoothness_reward = joint_smoothness_weight * joint_smoothness_reward
    
    # Total reward
    total_reward = speed_reward + upright_reward + joint_smoothness_reward - stability_penalty
    
    rewards = {
        "speed_reward": speed_reward,
        "upright_reward": upright_reward,
        "joint_smoothness_reward": joint_smoothness_reward,
        "stability_penalty": stability_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, rewards
```

### Adjustments Made:
- **Re-scaled Upright Reward**: Upright reward component now incorporates an exponential transformation to provide a continuous incentive, better guiding the agent to maintain proper posture.
- **Joint Smoothness Reward**: Introduced smoothness reward to promote more stable, smooth joint movements.
- **Adjusted Component Weights**: Readjusted weights ensuring better balance across components to maintain task efficiency.

The goal of these modifications is to further enhance policy effectiveness by carefully tuning reward incentives to address highlighted shortcomings while maintaining core goals of speed and stability.
