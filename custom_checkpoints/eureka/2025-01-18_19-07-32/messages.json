As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

        "content": "Analyzing the policy feedback and reward component values:\n\n1. **Speed Reward**:\n   - This component is scaling well with time. However, given the fluctuations in other metrics, there might be room to enhance its influence on the overall task score.\n\n2. **Upright Reward**:\n   - The values are nearly identical and saturate around 2.67. This indicates that the component does not effectively guide the policy towards desired behavior beyond a certain point. Adjusting the scaling or rewriting the component is necessary.\n\n3. **Stability Penalty**:\n   - This metric is effectively managed with low minimal values indicating some success in reducing penalties related to stability.\n\n4. **Task Score**:\n   - The task score is improving but relatively slowly. Considering the episode lengths, there's room for shorter or more consistent episodes without sacrificing performance.\n  \nGiven these observations, here's how we can improve the reward function:\n\n- Re-scale the upright reward to increase its impact.\n- Introduce a new reward component to encourage smooth joint movements, which could directly enhance stability and performance.\n  \nHere's the updated reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(root_states: torch.Tensor, dof_vel: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract relevant state information\n    torso_position = root_states[:, 0:3]\n    velocity = root_states[:, 7:10]\n    \n    # Compute direction to target and normalize\n    to_target = targets - torso_position\n    to_target[:, 2] = 0.0\n    normalized_to_target = torch.nn.functional.normalize(to_target, dim=-1)\n    \n    # Speed component: Project velocity onto the target direction\n    speed_along_target = (velocity * normalized_to_target).sum(dim=-1)\n    \n    # Maintain upright position (modified to scale appropriately with additional temperature)\n    target_z = 1.0\n    z_deviation = torch.abs(torso_position[:, 2] - target_z)\n    upright_temp = 1.0\n    upright_bonus = torch.exp(-upright_temp * z_deviation)\n\n    # Stability penalty and joint smoothness reward (to encourage smooth motion)\n    stability_penalty_weight = 1.0\n    stability_penalty = stability_penalty_weight * z_deviation\n    \n    dof_velocity_penalty_weight = 0.1\n    joint_smoothness_reward = torch.exp(-dof_velocity_penalty_weight * torch.norm(dof_vel, p=1, dim=-1))\n    \n    # Calculate overall reward\n    speed_reward_weight = 1.0\n    upright_bonus_weight = 0.5\n    joint_smoothness_weight = 0.4\n    \n    speed_temp = 0.2\n    \n    speed_reward = speed_reward_weight * torch.exp(speed_temp * speed_along_target)\n    upright_reward = upright_bonus_weight * upright_bonus\n    joint_smoothness_reward = joint_smoothness_weight * joint_smoothness_reward\n    \n    # Total reward\n    total_reward = speed_reward + upright_reward + joint_smoothness_reward - stability_penalty\n    \n    rewards = {\n        \"speed_reward\": speed_reward,\n        \"upright_reward\": upright_reward,\n        \"joint_smoothness_reward\": joint_smoothness_reward,\n        \"stability_penalty\": stability_penalty\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, rewards\n```\n\n### Adjustments Made:\n- **Re-scaled Upright Reward**: Upright reward component now incorporates an exponential transformation to provide a continuous incentive, better guiding the agent to maintain proper posture.\n- **Joint Smoothness Reward**: Introduced smoothness reward to promote more stable, smooth joint movements.\n- **Adjusted Component Weights**: Readjusted weights ensuring better balance across components to maintain task efficiency.\n\nThe goal of these modifications is to further enhance policy effectiveness by carefully tuning reward incentives to address highlighted shortcomings while maintaining core goals of speed and stability."
