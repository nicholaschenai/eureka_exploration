To design a reward function for the task of making the shadow hand spin an object to a target orientation, we want to incentivize the agent to align the object's current rotation to the goal rotation as closely as possible. We'll define a reward based on the rotational difference between the current object orientation and the goal orientation. Additionally, we'll lightly penalize the angular velocity to encourage stability once the object is close to the target orientation. Here's how such a reward function could be implemented:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Compute the rotational difference between the current object orientation and goal orientation
    rot_diff_tensor = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))[:, :4]  # Only take the first 4 elements as it's a quaternion
    rot_diff = torch.norm(rot_diff_tensor[:, :3], dim=1)  # Measure angular difference

    # Temperature parameters for transforming rewards
    rot_diff_temperature = 10.0
    angvel_temperature = 1.0

    # Reward for minimizing the rotational difference
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-rot_diff_temperature * rot_diff)

    # Penalty for the magnitude of angular velocity
    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-angvel_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))

    # Combine the rewards
    total_reward = orientation_reward + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty

    # Return the total reward and individual components
    reward_components = {
        "orientation_reward": orientation_reward,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

In this reward function:
- `orientation_reward`: Encourages the object to achieve the desired rotation by minimizing the angular difference.
- `angular_velocity_penalty`: Encourages the agent to stabilize the object to prevent excessive spinning once the target orientation is reached.
- Temperature parameters control how steeply the exponential functions penalize deviations from the desired state. Adjusting these can fine-tune the sensitivity of each component.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

To improve the reward function based on the provided feedback, let's analyze the results:

1. **Orientation Reward**:
   - The orientation reward is consistently at 0.00, suggesting it is either not being calculated correctly or is not within a valid range for RL to optimize effectively. This implies that the original transformation or calculation was ineffective. We should modify the calculation approach and potentially adjust its scaling.

2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**:
   - The angular velocity penalty is having some effect but it seems to plateau. A small modification in temperature might help refine its optimization. However, it might still be useful since it has been slightly effective.

3. **Task Score and Performance**:
   - The task score is very low, which is a direct indicator that the reward function is not driving the desired behavior effectively. Consequently, a complete overhaul might be needed.

The episode lengths have increased over time, which suggests that the policy is learning to prolong its interactions, potentially due to mild improvements from the velocity penalty, but ultimately without achieving the right orientations.

Here's an approach to redefine the reward with these insights:
- Introduce a more effective way to compute orientation difference as a reward.
- Adjust the orientation reward scaling.
- Consider an additional component that encourages movement towards the goal orientation.

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Compute the quaternion distance between current orientation and goal orientation
    quat_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    
    # Convert quaternion difference to angle (in radians)
    angular_distance = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(quat_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))

    # Temperature parameters for transforming rewards
    orientation_temperature = 2.0
    angvel_temperature = 1.0

    # Reward for minimizing the angular distance
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_temperature * angular_distance)

    # Penalty for the magnitude of angular velocity
    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-angvel_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))

    # Combine the rewards
    total_reward = orientation_reward + 0.05 * angular_velocity_penalty

    # Return the total reward and individual components
    reward_components = {
        "orientation_reward": orientation_reward,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

In this improved reward function:
- **Orientation Reward**: Redesigned to use angular distance derived from quaternions, making it more interpretable and possibly more effective in capturing the orientation deviations. Adjusted the scaling.
- **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Retained but slightly decreased in impact, keeping movements near equilibrium when possible. Adjusted the influence by changing its weight.
- **Combined Reward**: The reward is the sum of major contributions from orientation and a minor penalty contribution from the angular velocity to maintain a balanced and incentive-driven approach across tasks.

Based on the policy feedback, let's analyze and adjust each component of the reward function:

1. **Orientation Reward**:
   - The values for the orientation reward are showing saturation around 0.50 and not improving significantly. This indicates it might be mis-scaled or not effectively driving the desired behavior.
   - Action: We can increase its sensitivity by modifying the temperature or re-evaluate the transformation to encourage further optimization.

2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**:
   - Displays a slight increase over time but stays low, indicating it might not be contributing effectively to optimize velocity control.
   - Action: Consider increasing the penalty to motivate significant velocity reduction or reassess its role altogether.

3. **Task Score and Episode Lengths**:
   - Task score increases, showing overall improvement. Yet, the reward seems minimal relative to episode lengths as episodes grow too long.
   - Action: Needs stronger reward signals to speed up optimization.

With these insights, here’s a revised reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Compute the quaternion distance between current orientation and goal orientation
    quat_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    
    # Convert quaternion difference to angle (in radians)
    angular_distance = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(quat_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))

    # Re-defined transform temperatures for better scaling
    orientation_temperature = 3.0
    angvel_temperature = 0.5

    # Update orientation reward for increased sensitivity
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_temperature * angular_distance)

    # Increase penalty's impact to further reduce unnecessary angular velocity
    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-angvel_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))

    # Combine the rewards with an adjusted weight
    total_reward = 2.0 * orientation_reward + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty

    # Return the total reward and individual components
    reward_components = {
        "orientation_reward": orientation_reward,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

Revisions Explained:
- **Orientation Reward**: Increased temperature to 3.0 for greater scaling, aiming to break the 0.50 barrier and improve learning sensitivity.
- **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Decreased temperature to encourage a more significant role overall, balancing its relative influence with orientation rewards.
- **Weight Adjustments**: Doubled the influence of the orientation in the total reward, aligning it more closely to the primary task of achieving target orientation faster. This can help cut down episode lengths by providing better feedback.

Based on the policy feedback, the current reward components are not effectively guiding the agent toward success. Let's analyze and address each component:

1. **Orientation Reward**:
   - The orientation reward demonstrates improvement but plateaus quickly. The max is 0.55, which indicates the scale might be too low for a strong learning signal.
   - Suggested Action: Adjust the scale and tweak the temperature parameter for a broader score range to push improvements further.

2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**:
   - The penalty's component values are consistently low and show little variance, suggesting little contribution to the task's optimization.
   - Suggested Action: Re-evaluate its utility and potentially increase its influence to encourage better velocity management.

3. **Task Score and Episode Lengths**:
   - Success rates are low, with minimal efficiency in achieving tasks earlier. Episode lengths are long, showing inefficient task completion.
   - Suggested Action: Strengthen orientation incentives and encourage earlier task achievement by adjusting reward parameters and total reward structure.

Here’s a restructured and improved reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Compute the quaternion distance between current orientation and goal orientation
    quat_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    
    # Convert quaternion difference to angle (in radians)
    angular_distance = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(quat_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))

    # Setting new temperature parameters
    orientation_temperature = 5.0
    angvel_temperature = 1.0

    # Enhance orientation reward sensitivity
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_temperature * angular_distance)

    # Stronger penalization for high angular velocity, encouraging slower, controlled spins
    angular_velocity_penalty = 1.0 - torch.exp(-angvel_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))

    # Combine the rewards with adjusted weights
    total_reward = 3.0 * orientation_reward + 0.5 * angular_velocity_penalty

    # Return the total reward and individual components
    reward_components = {
        "orientation_reward": orientation_reward,
        "angular_velocity_penalty": angular_velocity_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, reward_components
```

Revisions Explained:
- **Orientation Reward**: Increased its temperature to 5.0, enhancing the reward for achieving the goal faster, widening the potential values and learning incentives.
- **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Refocused to penalize more effectively by adjusting the temperature, aiming to reduce excessive speed in spinning effectively.
- **Weighted Combination**: Increased the orientation's influence and limited angular velocity's impact, encouraging a stronger focus on reaching targeted goals quicker through a clearer reward path.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
orientation_reward: ['0.00', '0.01', '0.04', '0.13', '0.19', '0.25', '0.28', '0.31', '0.33', '0.34'], Max: 0.36, Mean: 0.21, Min: 0.00 
angular_velocity_penalty: ['0.99', '0.97', '0.95', '0.92', '0.91', '0.90', '0.89', '0.88', '0.88', '0.88'], Max: 0.99, Mean: 0.91, Min: 0.86 
task_score: ['0.00', '0.03', '0.06', '0.06', '0.08', '0.11', '0.18', '0.21', '0.25', '0.31'], Max: 0.39, Mean: 0.14, Min: 0.00 
episode_lengths: ['7.22', '506.52', '522.01', '548.31', '530.61', '551.88', '543.80', '510.93', '539.33', '517.54'], Max: 598.57, Mean: 510.98, Min: 7.22 
Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
