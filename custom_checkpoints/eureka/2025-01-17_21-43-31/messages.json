        "content": "Based on the policy feedback, the current reward components are not effectively guiding the agent toward success. Let's analyze and address each component:\n\n1. **Orientation Reward**:\n   - The orientation reward demonstrates improvement but plateaus quickly. The max is 0.55, which indicates the scale might be too low for a strong learning signal.\n   - Suggested Action: Adjust the scale and tweak the temperature parameter for a broader score range to push improvements further.\n\n2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**:\n   - The penalty's component values are consistently low and show little variance, suggesting little contribution to the task's optimization.\n   - Suggested Action: Re-evaluate its utility and potentially increase its influence to encourage better velocity management.\n\n3. **Task Score and Episode Lengths**:\n   - Success rates are low, with minimal efficiency in achieving tasks earlier. Episode lengths are long, showing inefficient task completion.\n   - Suggested Action: Strengthen orientation incentives and encourage earlier task achievement by adjusting reward parameters and total reward structure.\n\nHere\u2019s a restructured and improved reward function:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Compute the quaternion distance between current orientation and goal orientation\n    quat_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))\n    \n    # Convert quaternion difference to angle (in radians)\n    angular_distance = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(quat_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))\n\n    # Setting new temperature parameters\n    orientation_temperature = 5.0\n    angvel_temperature = 1.0\n\n    # Enhance orientation reward sensitivity\n    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_temperature * angular_distance)\n\n    # Stronger penalization for high angular velocity, encouraging slower, controlled spins\n    angular_velocity_penalty = 1.0 - torch.exp(-angvel_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))\n\n    # Combine the rewards with adjusted weights\n    total_reward = 3.0 * orientation_reward + 0.5 * angular_velocity_penalty\n\n    # Return the total reward and individual components\n    reward_components = {\n        \"orientation_reward\": orientation_reward,\n        \"angular_velocity_penalty\": angular_velocity_penalty\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\nRevisions Explained:\n- **Orientation Reward**: Increased its temperature to 5.0, enhancing the reward for achieving the goal faster, widening the potential values and learning incentives.\n- **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Refocused to penalize more effectively by adjusting the temperature, aiming to reduce excessive speed in spinning effectively.\n- **Weighted Combination**: Increased the orientation's influence and limited angular velocity's impact, encouraging a stronger focus on reaching targeted goals quicker through a clearer reward path."
