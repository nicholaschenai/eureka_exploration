As an example,\nthe reward function signature can be: @torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    ...\n    return reward, {}\n\nSince the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,\nplease make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). \nMake sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:\n    (1) the total reward,\n    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.\nThe code output should be formatted as a python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n\nSome helpful tips for writing the reward function code:\n    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components\n    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor\n    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.).

We can use angular distance directly as a penalty.\n\n2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**:\n   - **Problem**: The values are consistently high, showing it isn't effectively differentiating based on performance.\n   - **Action**: Adjust the scaling to better penalize undesirable velocities.\n\n3. **Distance to Goal Reward**:\n   - **Problem**: Consistently close to 1.0, showing insufficient sensitivity.\n   - **Action**: Fine-tune the scaling to encourage movements towards reducing the position difference.\n\n4. **Task Completion Bonus**:\n   - **Problem**: Zero values indicate the complete absence of successful orientations.\n   - **Action**: Adjust thresholds or the bonus itself to reflect partial orientations.\n\n5. **Overall Task Feedback**:\n   - **Observation**: Success rates zero and stagnant task scores indicate an overall ineffectiveness.\n   - **Action**: Consider introducing new reward incentives related to task interactions or progress milestones.\n\nHere's a revised reward function considering the above points:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor, object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Compute angular difference as continuous penalty\n    rotation_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))\n    angle_diff = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(rotation_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))\n    \n    # Updated orientation reward based on angular distance\n    orientation_penalty_temperature: float = 3.0\n    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_penalty_temperature * angle_diff)\n\n    # Penalize high angular velocities\n    angular_velocity_penalty_temperature: float = 1.0\n    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-angular_velocity_penalty_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))\n\n    # Reward for being close to the goal position\n    position_diff = torch.norm(object_pos - goal_pos, dim=1)\n    position_reward_temperature: float = 2.0\n    distance_to_goal_reward = torch.exp(-position_reward_temperature * position_diff)\n\n    # Task completion bonus to encourage reaching desirable orientations\n    goal_threshold = 0.1  # Tighter threshold for precision\n    task_completion_bonus = (angle_diff < goal_threshold).float() * 5.0  # Larger bonus for success\n\n    # Adjusted total reward combining different aspects\n    total_reward = (\n        2.0 * orientation_reward +\n        1.0 * angular_velocity_penalty +\n        1.5 * distance_to_goal_reward +\n        task_completion_bonus\n    )\n\n    reward_dict = {\n        'orientation_reward': orientation_reward,\n        'angular_velocity_penalty': angular_velocity_penalty,\n        'distance_to_goal_reward': distance_to_goal_reward,\n        'task_completion_bonus': task_completion_bonus\n    }\n\n    return total_reward, reward_dict\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Orientation Reward**: Uses continuous feedback through angular distance, with increased sensitivity.\n- **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Re-assessed scaling to distinguish performance variations.\n- **Distance to Goal Reward**: Adjusted to better represent progress, with increased scaling.\n- **Task Completion Bonus**: New, more achievable criterion for bonuses to reflect possible interactions.\n- **Total Reward**: Balanced weights to ensure no single component overshadows others, providing comprehensive guidance. \n\nThis refactoring aims to address stagnation issues, promote continuous learning, and align incentives with desired outcomes."
