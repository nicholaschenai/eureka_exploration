To solve the task of making the hand spin the object to a target orientation, the reward function should be based on how well the object's rotation aligns with the goal rotation. We will consider components like the orientation alignment and optionally the velocities, to make sure the movement is smooth. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Calculate the rotation error using quaternion multiplication
    rotation_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    angle_diff = 2 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(rotation_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))  # Extract angle from quaternion

    # Orientation alignment reward (negative of angle difference)
    orientation_reward_temperature: float = 0.1
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_reward_temperature * angle_diff)

    # Optionally, penalize angular velocity to encourage smooth rotation towards the goal
    angular_velocity_penalty_temperature: float = 0.05
    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-angular_velocity_penalty_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))

    # Total reward is a weighted sum of individual components
    total_reward = orientation_reward + 0.2 * angular_velocity_penalty

    # Create a dictionary for each individual reward component
    reward_dict = {
        'orientation_reward': orientation_reward,
        'angular_velocity_penalty': angular_velocity_penalty
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation:
1. **Orientation Alignment (`orientation_reward`)**: We use quaternion operations to compute the rotation difference between the object's current orientation and the goal orientation. The reward is then derived from the negative of this angle difference, transformed via an exponential function.

2. **Angular Velocity Penalty (`angular_velocity_penalty`)**: We introduce this component optionally to minimize unnecessary spinning. It helps encourage the agent to rotate towards the goal smoothly.

3. **Combination**: The total reward is a linear combination of both components. You can adjust the weights according to how much you want to prioritize each component.

These components together should help the agent learn how to effectively spin the object to the desired target orientation.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
orientation_reward: ['0.72', '0.76', '0.77', '0.78', '0.80', '0.82', '0.83', '0.83', '0.83', '0.83'], Max: 0.83, Mean: 0.80, Min: 0.72

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the provided policy feedback, it's evident that the current reward function isn't effectively driving the learning process towards success. The high episode lengths, near-zero success rates, and the stagnation in orientation_reward and angular_velocity_penalty suggest that modifications are needed.

### Analysis:
1. **Orientation Reward**: This component shows slight improvement but has stagnated. Adjusting its temperature parameter or altering its formulation could help provide a more dynamic range for learning.
   
2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Although angular velocity is somewhat controlled, the component does not seem to significantly impact task success. It may need to be re-scaled or re-formulated to allow a broader impact.

3. **Task Score**: Remaining zero indicates that the existing reward structure isn't adequately incentivizing task completion.

### Adjustments:
- Increase the sensitivity of the orientation reward by adjusting the temperature parameter.
- Reformulate the angular velocity penalty to ensure it doesn't dominate the learning process yet still promotes smooth rotation.
- Introduce a new term to more directly incentivize task completion, such as a distance metric to a desired goal state.

Here's the improved reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Calculate the rotation error using quaternion multiplication
    rotation_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    angle_diff = 2 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(rotation_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))  # Extract angle from quaternion

    # Orientation alignment reward
    orientation_reward_temperature: float = 0.5
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_reward_temperature * angle_diff)

    # Reformulate angular velocity penalty
    angular_velocity_penalty_weight: float = 0.1
    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-torch.norm(object_angvel * angular_velocity_penalty_weight, dim=1))

    # New task completion reward based on position difference
    position_diff = torch.norm(object_pos - goal_pos, dim=1)
    position_reward_temperature: float = 0.5
    position_reward = torch.exp(-position_reward_temperature * position_diff)

    # Total reward is a weighted sum of individual components
    total_reward = 1.0 * orientation_reward + 0.1 * angular_velocity_penalty + 0.5 * position_reward

    # Create a dictionary for each individual reward component
    reward_dict = {
        'orientation_reward': orientation_reward,
        'angular_velocity_penalty': angular_velocity_penalty,
        'position_reward': position_reward
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation:
1. **Orientation Reward**: The temperature parameter has been increased to make the orientation reward component more sensitive.

2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Reformulated to minimize domination over other rewards, keeping smoothness a secondary goal.

3. **Position Reward**: Added a new reward component to encourage the hand to bring the object’s current position closer to the target position, promoting task completion. 

These modifications should provide a more balanced and effective reward structure to help the agent learn the task of aligning the object orientation with the desired orientation more effectively.

Based on the policy feedback and metrics, the current reward function does not effectively guide the agent towards solving the task. Here’s a breakdown of issues and potential improvements:

### Analysis of Reward Components:

1. **Orientation Reward**: The orientation reward shows some improvement but has plateaued. The small spread between the max, mean, and min values suggests insufficient sensitivity. We may need to adjust its scaling or redesign it to provide a larger gradient.

2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**: This component is relatively constant and high throughout training, indicating that it might be either too lenient or not effectively penalizing deviations. We should reassess its relevance and scaling.

3. **Position Reward**: This component is consistently high and unvarying, suggesting optimization isn't required as much or correctly formulated. Reassessing its role or entirely removing it may be beneficial.

4. **Task Score**: Near-zero task scores indicate the reward structure does not contribute towards achieving tasks. We need a new component to replace or augment those failing.

### Proposed Reward Function:

1. **Orientation Error**: Keep and adjust, providing higher gradients with proper scaling.
2. **Angular Velocity Constraint**: Possibly reformulate to focus on angular control at crucial steps.
3. **Distance to Goal**: Reintroduce as a separate component with adjusted scaling.
4. **Task Completion Bonus**: Encourage quick completion or aligning the object beyond a threshold.

Here is a revised reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Calculate the rotation error using quaternion multiplication
    rotation_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    angle_diff = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(rotation_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))

    # Orientation alignment reward with adjusted sensitivity
    orientation_reward_temperature: float = 1.0
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_reward_temperature * angle_diff)

    # Reformulated angular velocity constraint to maintain relevance
    angular_velocity_constraint_weight: float = 0.5
    angular_velocity_constraint = torch.exp(-torch.norm(object_angvel * angular_velocity_constraint_weight, dim=1))

    # Reintroduce task distance component
    position_diff = torch.norm(object_pos - goal_pos, dim=1)
    position_reward_temperature: float = 0.8
    distance_to_goal_reward = torch.exp(-position_reward_temperature * position_diff)

    # Add a new task completion bonus for achieving a near-goal orientation
    goal_thres = 0.1  # radian threshold for goal orientation
    task_completion_bonus = (angle_diff < goal_thres).float()

    # Total reward as a combination of components
    total_reward = (
        1.0 * orientation_reward +
        0.3 * angular_velocity_constraint +
        0.5 * distance_to_goal_reward +
        0.2 * task_completion_bonus
    )

    reward_dict = {
        'orientation_reward': orientation_reward,
        'angular_velocity_constraint': angular_velocity_constraint,
        'distance_to_goal_reward': distance_to_goal_reward,
        'task_completion_bonus': task_completion_bonus
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation:

- **Orientation Reward**: Adjusted the temperature for increased sensitivity to small orientation differences.
- **Angular Velocity Constraint**: Reformulated to ensure it accurately represents the desired smooth rotation.
- **Distance to Goal Reward**: Controlled by a new scaling, ensuring it's impactful but not overwhelming.
- **Task Completion Bonus**: A direct incentive for task completion upon achieving a specific goal state beyond just alignment.
   
These modifications aim to balance the reward components and provide a clearer learning gradient for the agent.

Given the feedback, the current reward function seems to be ineffective in driving the policy towards success. Let's address each component:

1. **Orientation Reward**: The values are low and stagnant, showing little improvement over epochs. This component may need to be rescaled or reformulated for better sensitivity.

2. **Angular Velocity Constraint**: This component appears to have high values, potentially dominating the reward structure, thus needing a reassessment of scaling or reducing its weight.

3. **Distance to Goal Reward**: This component seems stable and relevant but is not leading to task completion, requiring alignment with task completion via a corrective scaling.

4. **Task Completion Bonus**: This is consistently zero, showing that the agent never reaches a desirable state. This may mean our goal threshold is too tight; we may need a more reachable target within the training process.

5. **Task Score**: The low rates indicate the agent fails at task accomplishment, suggesting the reward function as a whole is ineffective.

With these insights, we need to revise each part, focusing on better scaling and alignment to achieve task success. Here's a revised reward function:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor, object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Quaternion-based orientation error
    rotation_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    angle_diff = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(rotation_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))
    
    # Orientation alignment: increase temperature to make it more sensitive
    orientation_reward_temperature: float = 5.0
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_reward_temperature * angle_diff)

    # Angular velocity penalty to discourage excessive motion
    angular_velocity_penalty_weight: float = 0.2
    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-torch.norm(object_angvel * angular_velocity_penalty_weight, dim=1))

    # Distance to goal: re-scale to encourage reaching the goal
    position_diff = torch.norm(object_pos - goal_pos, dim=1)
    position_reward_temperature: float = 0.5
    distance_to_goal_reward = torch.exp(-position_reward_temperature * position_diff)

    # Task completion bonus: adjust the condition for a practical threshold
    goal_threshold = 0.2  # Radian threshold for bonus
    task_completion_bonus = (angle_diff < goal_threshold).float()

    # Combine components for total reward
    total_reward = (
        1.0 * orientation_reward +
        0.2 * angular_velocity_penalty +
        0.5 * distance_to_goal_reward +
        2.0 * task_completion_bonus
    )

    reward_dict = {
        'orientation_reward': orientation_reward,
        'angular_velocity_penalty': angular_velocity_penalty,
        'distance_to_goal_reward': distance_to_goal_reward,
        'task_completion_bonus': task_completion_bonus
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation:

- **Orientation Reward**: Temperature increased to enhance the agent's sensitivity to small orientation discrepancies.
- **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Reduced weight to prevent it from overshadowing other reward components.
- **Distance to Goal Reward**: Re-scaled to ensure it's appropriately encouraging the agent to approach the goal.
- **Task Completion Bonus**: A practical threshold makes this bonus achievable, motivating the agent to reach a near-goal orientation.

This revised function aims to provide clearer guidance and incentives for the agent to improve performance in the task of spinning the object to the desired orientation.

We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths after every 300 epochs and the maximum, mean, minimum values encountered:
orientation_reward: ['0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00'], Max: 0.00, Mean: 0.00, Min: 0.00

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Based on the provided feedback, let's analyze each component of the reward function and provide a revised version to better guide the agent:

1. **Orientation Reward**:
   - **Problem**: The reward is consistently zero, meaning the agent doesn't improve its orientation relative to the target.
   - **Action**: Rewrite this component to provide continuous feedback. We can use angular distance directly as a penalty.

2. **Angular Velocity Penalty**:
   - **Problem**: The values are consistently high, showing it isn't effectively differentiating based on performance.
   - **Action**: Adjust the scaling to better penalize undesirable velocities.

3. **Distance to Goal Reward**:
   - **Problem**: Consistently close to 1.0, showing insufficient sensitivity.
   - **Action**: Fine-tune the scaling to encourage movements towards reducing the position difference.

4. **Task Completion Bonus**:
   - **Problem**: Zero values indicate the complete absence of successful orientations.
   - **Action**: Adjust thresholds or the bonus itself to reflect partial orientations.

5. **Overall Task Feedback**:
   - **Observation**: Success rates zero and stagnant task scores indicate an overall ineffectiveness.
   - **Action**: Consider introducing new reward incentives related to task interactions or progress milestones.

Here's a revised reward function considering the above points:

```python
@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(object_rot: torch.Tensor, goal_rot: torch.Tensor, object_angvel: torch.Tensor, object_pos: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Compute angular difference as continuous penalty
    rotation_diff = quat_mul(object_rot, quat_conjugate(goal_rot))
    angle_diff = 2.0 * torch.acos(torch.clamp(rotation_diff[:, 0], -1.0, 1.0))
    
    # Updated orientation reward based on angular distance
    orientation_penalty_temperature: float = 3.0
    orientation_reward = torch.exp(-orientation_penalty_temperature * angle_diff)

    # Penalize high angular velocities
    angular_velocity_penalty_temperature: float = 1.0
    angular_velocity_penalty = torch.exp(-angular_velocity_penalty_temperature * torch.norm(object_angvel, dim=1))

    # Reward for being close to the goal position
    position_diff = torch.norm(object_pos - goal_pos, dim=1)
    position_reward_temperature: float = 2.0
    distance_to_goal_reward = torch.exp(-position_reward_temperature * position_diff)

    # Task completion bonus to encourage reaching desirable orientations
    goal_threshold = 0.1  # Tighter threshold for precision
    task_completion_bonus = (angle_diff < goal_threshold).float() * 5.0  # Larger bonus for success

    # Adjusted total reward combining different aspects
    total_reward = (
        2.0 * orientation_reward +
        1.0 * angular_velocity_penalty +
        1.5 * distance_to_goal_reward +
        task_completion_bonus
    )

    reward_dict = {
        'orientation_reward': orientation_reward,
        'angular_velocity_penalty': angular_velocity_penalty,
        'distance_to_goal_reward': distance_to_goal_reward,
        'task_completion_bonus': task_completion_bonus
    }

    return total_reward, reward_dict
```

### Explanation:

- **Orientation Reward**: Uses continuous feedback through angular distance, with increased sensitivity.
- **Angular Velocity Penalty**: Re-assessed scaling to distinguish performance variations.
- **Distance to Goal Reward**: Adjusted to better represent progress, with increased scaling.
- **Task Completion Bonus**: New, more achievable criterion for bonuses to reflect possible interactions.
- **Total Reward**: Balanced weights to ensure no single component overshadows others, providing comprehensive guidance. 

This refactoring aims to address stagnation issues, promote continuous learning, and align incentives with desired outcomes.
